    "This diagram illustrates the flow of data and interactions between different components of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hugging Face GAIA Dataset**: The GAIA dataset is downloaded using Python scripts within the Airflow container.\n",
    "* **Data Storage**: \n",
    "  - The dataset and relevant files are stored in an unstructured format (e.g., PDFs, JSON, TXT) within an S3 bucket.\n",
    "  - Metadata is also loaded and stored in a metadata table (RDS).\n",
    "* **Data Processing**:\n",
    "  - The unstructured files (e.g., PDFs) are processed using tools such as PyMuPDF4LLM and Unstructured API. \n",
    "  - The processed data (e.g., JSON, TXT files) is stored back into S3 directories for further retrieval.\n",
    "* **Airflow Pipeline**:\n",
    "  - The entire process (downloading, processing, storing data) is orchestrated and automated using Airflow tasks.\n",
    "  - Airflow is containerized to manage each step of the process, ensuring scalability and efficient task execution.\n",
    "* **Streamlit User Interface**:\n",
    "  - End-users interact with the system through a Streamlit-based user interface where they can provide inputs, select questions, and initiate data queries.\n",
    "  - The interface connects to the FastAPI backend to retrieve stored files and relevant metadata for user-selected questions.\n",
    "* **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "  - Files and metadata are retrieved from the S3 storage and metadata table based on the user's selections in the Streamlit interface.\n",
    "* **OpenAI API**:\n",
    "  - The user inputs, selected questions, and retrieved files are sent to the OpenAI API for language model-based analysis.\n",
    "  - The API returns large language model (LLM) responses based on the processed data and user inputs.\n",
    "* **Result Display**:\n",
    "  - The LLM responses from the OpenAI API are returned to the Streamlit interface, where the results are displayed for the user.\n",
    "  - Users can interact with the results and update their inputs as needed for further queries.\n"
